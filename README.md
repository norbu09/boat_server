# BoatServer

This is currently a first draft and super rough around the edges. It imports
data from a local SignalK server and exposes the data as a Prometheus endpoint.
In my setup that gets picked up by Grafana to draw pretty pictures.

Handy documentation of all the data fields and formats in SignalK:
